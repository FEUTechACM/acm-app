- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Doppler CLI](https://docs.doppler.com/docs/cli)

### Getting Started

0. You must have the pre-requisites installed.

   ```bash
    # Check if Node.js is installed
    node -v

    # Check if Yarn is installed
    yarn -v

    # Check if Git is installed
    git --version

    # Check if Docker is installed
    docker -v

    # Check if Doppler CLI is installed (Environment variables are injected at runtime)
    doppler -v
    /
   ```

1. Clone the repository and change directory.

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FEUTechACM/acm-app.git acm-app
    # or
    git clone git@github.com:FEUTechACM/acm-app.git acm-app

    cd acm-app
   ```

2. Switch to the `develop` branch or target branch.

   ```bash
    git checkout develop
    # or
    git checkout <branch-name>
   ```

3. Branch out from `develop` if not on target branch.

   ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

4. Install the dependencies.

   ```bash
    yarn install
   ```

5. Run the development server.

   ```bash
    yarn devx
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Project Standards

#### Workflow

![GitFlow Workflow](https://iamchuka.com/content/images/2018/05/gitflowimage.png)

For this project, we use the [GitFlow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

#### GitFlow Rules

1. Do not commit directly to `master` and `develop` branch.
2. Feature branch should be **MERGED** to `develop` branch.
3. Hotfix and release branch should be **MERGED** to `master` branch and `develop` branch.
4. Do not nest branch names e.g. `feature/parent/child`.

#### Git Guidelines

1. **NEVER** rebase the `master` and `develop` branch.
2. Make use of `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull`.
3. Frequently rebase your feature branch against develop.
4. Always branch out from `develop` or `feature` branch.
5. Use only `--force-with-lease` if in need to force push.
6. Make use of `git commit --amend` if you need to edit your commit message.
7. Make use of `git rebase -i` if you need to modify your commit history.

#### Commit Rules

We adopt the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specifications aligned with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with a few modifications.

#### Commit Message Format

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Note**: An (\*) asterisk before the commit description indicates that there is more information written in the commit message body.

#### Commit Message Example

1. **fix:** a bugfix
2. **feat:** a new feature
3. **refactor:** a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
4. **chore:** changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
5. **style:** changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (whitespace, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
6. **docs:** documentation only changes
7. **test:** adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
8. **perf:** a code change that improves performance
9. **ci:** changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
10. **build:** changes that affect the build tool or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
11. **revert:** revert to a commit
12. **BREAKING CHANGE:** introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/))
